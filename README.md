# AWS CLI Manager

This project is a command-line tool written in Go that helps manage the AWS CLI on your system. It checks if the AWS CLI is installed, and if not, it downloads and installs the correct version based on your system's architecture and operating system.

## Demo Scripts

The `demo` directory contains several scripts to demonstrate the features of AWS CLI Manager:

### Screenshot Demos
To take screenshots for documentation or presentations, you can use these scripts:

```bash
# Set up demo scripts
cd demo
chmod +x *.sh

# Generate dummy AWS profiles (safe for screenshots)
./generate_dummy_profiles.sh

# Run the dummy profile screenshot script
./make_demo.sh
```

The dummy profiles include:
- `demo-dev` (us-east-1) - Basic profile
- `demo-staging` (eu-west-1) - Initially selected profile
- `demo-prod` (us-west-2) - SSO-enabled profile
- `demo-admin` (us-east-2) - SSO-enabled profile

These profiles use fake credentials and are safe to include in screenshots.

## Autocompletion
To enable autocompletion for the tool, you can run the following command:
```bash
echo 'source <(aws-cli-manager completion SHELL)' >> ~/.SHEELrc
```
Please replace `SHELL` with the shell you are using (bash, zsh, fish).

If you don't to add the command to your shell configuration file, you can run the following command:
```bash
aws-cli-manager  completion SHELL -h
```

This will output a command that you can run to enable autocompletion without modifying your shell configuration file.
